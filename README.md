## Using Makefile


```make main```
For running baseline code

## For Method 1

```make m1```

To run method one then run

```./m1.out video_name parameter(Number of frames to be skipped)```

## For Method 2

```make m2```

To run method one then run \n

```./m2.out video_name scale```

Here Scale is the factor by which we have to reduce the frame resolution \n

## For Method 3

```make m3```

To run method one then run \n

```./m3.out video_name Number_of_threads```

## For Method 4

```make m4```

To run method one then run \n

```./m4.out video_name Number_of_threads```


For detail information about make command See MakeFile

For Method 3 and 4 if Num_of_threads = 0 then code will run autonomously for all threads from 1 to 10


```make clean```

Use this command to clean/remove all .out files
